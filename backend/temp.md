❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a+ b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` does not declare or define the variables `a` and `b`. These variables are likely intended to be
the inputs to the function, but they are not specified as parameters. This will lead to the function relying on
variables from the surrounding scope (if they exist), which makes the function's behavior unpredictable and hard to
reason about.
* ❌ There is missing whitespace that reduces readability.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ The function now explicitly declares `a` and `b` as parameters. This makes it clear that these are the intended
inputs.
* ✔ Includes whitespace for improved readability.
* ✔ Provides a return value that can be used by the calling code.
